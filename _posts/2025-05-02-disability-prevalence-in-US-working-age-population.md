Here we're looking at U.S. Census Bureau data^1^ from 2023. 

Overall, 13.7 percent of the "civilian noninstitutionalized population" in the United States (plus Puerto Rico) is considered disabled. As you might expect, it skews to the old.

| Age group | Percent disabled |
| --- | --- |
| Under 5 years | 0.7% |
| 5 to 17 years | 6.6% |
| 18 to 34 years | 8.6% |
| 35 to 64 years | 12.7% |
| 65 to 74 years | 24.1% |
| 75 years and over | 45.6% |

How about those of working age? For simplicity, we'll define this as ages from 18 to 64. In this demographic, there is a nationwide disability rate of 11.2 percent.

</script>

A straightforward guess as why some states have a greater share of disabilities in their working-age population is that their economies feature more manual labor jobs and fewer cozy office jobs than others, although there are likely numerous factors.
